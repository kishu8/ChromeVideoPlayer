# ChromeVideoPlayer
Since Chrome is capable of playing video files, this is an honest attempt to extend its capabilities.
This is a simple extension for chrome, that attaches keyboard shortcuts to video tag when a supported video file is opened to be played in chrome.

# How to load the unpacked extension
1. Fork the repository to a folder, say CVP.
2. Open 'chrome://extensions/' page 
3. Click on 'Load unpacked extension..'
4. Browse to the location of the folder containing the extension files (CVP, in this case).
5. Open any supported video file format and use the extension.

Congratulations!!! ..  You are good to go!!
